# OpenXilogGo

Open source redesign of Ovarro XilogGo.

## Usage

To use the app, it requires an API Token Key, which can be obtained [here](https://atriumiot.com/accountmanagement)

This Token Key should then be addded to the project through a .env file in your root directory. The variable name should be `API_KEY`

Here is a file example:

```
    # Path: .env
    API_KEY=""
```

The app is built using the Flutter SDK
